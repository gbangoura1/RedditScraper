lpkfftm,1fs5svk,"My daughter will be applying for Fall '25. She's read up on what's important to her, but I had a question about the food? From what I've read, WashU had really good dining. Has that changed since Sodexo's been in charge? I know, priorities. WashU is near the top of her list so even iffy food won't be a deterrent. (and most colleges have iffy food regardless.)",lovemypepsi
lrcx7nz,1fs5svk,"Wondering if I should apply ED 1 and test optional

I am a senior in high school and only in like the past week did I learn about early admission, and the increased acceptance rate. My initial reaction was to get my stuff together (bad at procrastinating 😭) and get some essays written and get my application in.

However, my ACT superscore is a 32, which I'm not the happiest with, contrary to taking and passing 6 AP exams so far, being the first person my chemistry teacher has had get a 5 on AP Chem, out of a high school with a student body of 1600.

I'm also really pessimistic about my writing skills. I really don't think I can write well, so that's not blowing anybody away.

About finances, I feel like my family is in a position where on paper it may appear we don't need financial aid, but we actually do.

I thought about making a 90 second video talking about some things I've done in my coding classes, as I want to major in computer science. Like I made a console tic tac toe game, and currently am working on a battleship game against an ""AI"", which is really just a random number generator with a bit of extra logic in place (like if it gets a hit, it'll play somewhere in an adjacent square).

Sorry for the length, but what would you guys say? Try for early decision? Test optional? Thanks a lot!",bananabeast07
m6awdbe,1fs5svk,"Hi Everyone! I'm a South Asian and I come from a competitive high school. I have a 3.8 UW gpa and a 35 ACT. I have taken 9 AP's and 11 honors (max courseload). I want to major in anthropology and all of my activities are geared towards research in global health/anthropology, creating non profits and apps, and working with kids from all over the world to better their health. I think my essays and LOR's are pretty solid. I also did the optional supplemental and video.

lu4igjf,1fs5svk,"What did y’all name drop about washu for supplemental?

Hey guys! I’m working on my WashU supplemental and I’ve been told to dive deeper into what makes WashU unique and why I’m drawn to it. So far, I’ve written about my interest in “Web Development for Social Change,” but it seems I need to get more specific with what WashU has to offer that’s really unique.

For those who applied, what did yall mention? Any memorable name drops or specific details you threw in there that helped make your app stand out? Would love some examples of what worked for you! Thanks!!",Historical-Leading81

mo1smoi,1k3fe3i,"My advice is to don’t overthink it and treat the bathroom like you would in any other public space. Keep it clean and functioning, and be aware of how long you can occupy the bathroom before other people likely need to use it. A majority of people will have their own shampoo, conditioner, etc, so as long as you know what stuff is who’s and the bathroom is clean, you should be good. The busiest time is likely in the morning right before classes. You can always ask your suite mates/roommates what time their morning classes are and plan your schedule around that. Personally, I wake up around 6 or 7 am, and get everything done by 7:45-7:50, that way I don’t get in the way of my roommates and I can chill before my first class at 9 am. Again, don’t overthink things and you should be fine.",FBOXO36_SPR1

mo1ss2y,1k3f4ps,"Quadrangle, the WashU grad student housing company, is off campus so I'm not sure what you mean. It's older buildings (a lot of buildings around here are pretty old) but they're well maintained nowadays from what I've heard. Main advantage is the location and price, as these tend to be in convenient and safe areas.

Wrt living in the city avoid Lux Living (they're getting sued right now and one of their apts was like evacuated because it was collapsing elsewhere in the city) and define a budget and figure out if you're bringing a car because that changes what areas you can feasibly live in. Expect things to be more expensive than washu housing tho",RandomMan0880

mnxxgyk,1k2y5gd,"- Go even to big lecture classes and little tutorials that seem unnecessary, because going to stuff may help keep you sane. 

- Especially if you’re in the humanities or social sciences, getting a campus job, or being active in something like a fraternity, Student Life or Frisbee golf is as important as going to class. Your classes might be a little easier than if you were in engineering, but that’s because you’re supposed to be doing interesting things outside of class.

mny3jgw,1k2y5gd,"Really take time to introspect on what you want and how you want to develop. Think about what it is, precisely you want then seek them out. Nobody can tell you what you should do, we can only suggest avenues to pursue your desires. So I guess I wish I knew how to access these different opportunities. In that case, advisors are such major help and people at particular departments. Speak to these people, that is why they are there.",Busy-Dog1480
mo0c8q0,1k2y5gd,"I don't have any concrete advice to give other than try school or extracurricular stuff you think is cool and have introspection running as a background process. In other words, do something you find interesting, reflect on the experience and whether you want to keep doing it (and how), and go from there. It's okay if the takeaway is that whatever you did sucked -- no one can like everything. On the opposite side of the coin, though, no one can know for certain that they \_won't\_ like something, so at least you gave that something a try

I came into college thinking I'd do one thing and graduated on track to do something completely different (disclaimer that the ""something completely different"" was on my list of potential post-grad options, but wasn't one I think I seriously entertained until I committed sometime in my third year). Even then, I still use the strategy I mentioned because the specific path I'll take on my current academic, personal, and professional trajectory is up in the air, and this is the way I plan to figure it out for now",MundyyyT
