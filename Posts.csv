Some helpful Craigslist-esc tips from u/iEatSponge to prevent scams:

* After you DM someone initially, switch to WashU Outlook (to confirm they're a student)
* Meet in a public place. The WUPD front vestibule area is staffed and recorded 24/7.
* If you're purchasing something from someone who isn't affiliated with the university, PAY IN CASH *ONLY*!"
1fs5svk,20,42,sgRNACas9,Mod Post,2024-2025 Prospective Student Megathread,"**Hey everyone,**

**Prospective students: please post your questions here instead of in its own post, especially for FAQs.**
With the college application season underway, we wanted to create a space where we can consolidate and centralize questions from prospective students about WashU. 

On our sub, we are lucky to have many current students, alumni, faculty/staff, and parents who browse and engage. These individuals may graciously answer your questions about WashU from their anecdotal experience and knowledge. This is an invaluable way to answer your specific questions with the first-hand experience of WashU-affiliates. 

Please note, the vast majority of people here do not work in admissions and do not know the real processes for admissions and reasons why people get admitted. We also largely lack knowledge about many other schools, with exceptions. Therefore, we are not well equipped to help you with certain questions, specifically “chance me” and “school vs. school” questions. Please, if you have concerns related to these, contact your high school's college and career counselor and/or Admissions Officer or contact the [admissions@wustl.edu](mailto:admissions@wustl.edu) email address.

1k3ruxc,4,5,Embarrassed-File2247,Admissions,WashU's Math Department,"I was recently admitted to both WashU and UW Madison and I need to choose between the two. 

I see that WashU is ranked higher overall, 21, as per US News. Many people I know are suggesting I go to WashU due to its prestige, internship opportunities and future employment. 

However, I can't find much info on the math department there and it specifically is ranked much lower in comparison to UW Madison. I do see a lot of admitted students going for math though so that is a good sign...idk.

Additionally, the cost factor comes in and WashU is insanely expensive but I would like more info before I make a decision. Would really appreciate your inputs. "

1k3f4ps,1,1,Natural_Meat,Housing,Housing for graduate students,Hello! Newly admitted grad student here. I was wondering if anybody has perspectives on housing in St. Louis for a grad student. I prefer to live alone; specifically I prefer a studio or a one-bedroom apartment. Does anyone know if WashU’s properties are better than those outside campus? Any advice would be great!
